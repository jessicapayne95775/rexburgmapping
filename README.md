# Overview

This is a mapping software that has locations to take kids for things to do in Rexburg, Idaho. I wrote this software to benefit parents, including myself, to help to know what to do and where to go in Rexburg to have a fun, wholesome, recreational time. There are many features besides just the points on a map. If you click on a point, a pop-up description of the place will come up. There is also a "locate me" feature that always you to see where your current location on the map is so you can see what is close to you. Lastly there is a search bar in the upper right corner to search for addresses to also conveniently see how far the points are from the specified address. This was the start to learning arcGIS mapping and I plan to continue my learning and progress to improve myself as a software engineer.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code for my IDE and Github for my version control. Coordinates for the locations were pulled from google maps by clicking a point.

This software was written with html, javascript, and json. The html and javascript displays the map while the json holds the names and coordinates for the locations. esri library was also used to generate the map attributes.

# Future Work

* Food places near the selected point
* Distance from current location
* More locations and better descriptions
